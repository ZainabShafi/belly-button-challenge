# belly-button-challenge

##OVERVIEW: 

Created an interactive dashboard utilizing Javascript, D3.js and Plotly that explored the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbes that inhabit human navels. The dataset shows that a few microbial species, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study, were found in over 70% of individuals, while the remaining species were relatively uncommon. The interactive site has been added to Github pages. 


##CODE WALKTHROUGH: 

```
function init()
```

1) Began by writing code to utilize D3.js databinding techniques to extract "names" data which contained all test subject ID numbers. Further utilized D3.js to append the data to the corresponding HTML elements to create an interactive dropdown menu, which allows the user to select a test subject number ID. Code snippet below:
